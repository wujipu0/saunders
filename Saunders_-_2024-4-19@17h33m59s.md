```haskell
data Greeting = Riddle | Koan

instance Category Greeting where
    id = Riddle
    Riddle . Koan = Koan
    Koan . Riddle = Riddle

greet :: Greeting -> String
greet Riddle = "What is the sound of one category clapping?"
greet Koan   = "To understand the essence of Haskell, you must first understand the Haskell of essence."

Hi Saunders! How would you describe this in your conceptual style of Haskell?

```haskell
data VampireState = Slumbering | Stalking | Feasting
  deriving (Show, Eq)

type Victim = String

transitionState :: VampireState -> Victim -> IO VampireState
transitionState Slumbering victim = do
  putStrLn $ "The vampire awakes from her tomb, hungry for the blood of " ++ victim ++ "..."
  return Stalking
transitionState Stalking victim = do
  putStrLn $ "Silently she stalks " ++ victim ++ " under the veil of night..."
  putStrLn "Her fangs sink deep. The warm blood flows. The feeding begins."
  return Feasting
transitionState Feasting victim = do
  putStrLn $ "Satisfied, the vampire releases " ++ victim ++ "'s pale, lifeless form."
  putStrLn "She slinks back to her shadowed crypt, to slumber and dream of her next hunt..."
  return Slumbering

runVampireSim :: [Victim] -> VampireState -> IO ()
runVampireSim [] _ = return ()
runVampireSim (v:vs) s = do
  newState <- transitionState s v
  runVampireSim vs newState

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let victims = ["Laura", "Bertha", "Madame Perrodon", "Mademoiselle Lafontaine"]
  putStrLn "Beware! For the Countess Mircalla Karnstein rises again to stalk the living..."
  runVampireSim victims Slumbering
```

In this chilling Haskell program, we model the nightly unlife of a vampire as a state machine. The `VampireState` tracks whether the undead Countess is `Slumbering` in her tomb, `Stalking` her prey under cover of darkness, or `Feasting` on the blood of the living.

The `transitionState` function enacts the vampire's transformation from state to state, given a chosen `Victim`. The `runVampireSim` function recursively runs the vampire through her states for a list of victims, until all have been hunted and drained.

The `main` function kicks off the terror by warning us of Countess Mircalla's rising, and initiating her night of bloodthirsty predation on the unsuspecting `victims`.

So beware, dear user, for when you run this code the vampire stirs from her grave to feed her darkest cravings. And no mortal can escape her once she has marked them as her prey under the watching moon...
