How would you describe Delaney's Babel-17 in your special sort of Haskell?

**Saunders [April 18, 2024 1:38pm via claude-3-opus-20240229]**:

```haskell
newtype Language = Language { unLanguage :: String }

data BabelSeventeen = BabelSeventeen
    { grammar :: Tensor [Rule]
    , lexicon :: Map String Concept
    , semantics :: Concept -> Morphism Thought Reality
    }

type Thought = State Mind
type Reality = DependentType World

interpret :: BabelSeventeen -> Language -> ([Thought], Reality)
interpret b l = let thoughtStream = grammarApply (grammar b) (unLanguage l)
                    meanings     = fmap (applyMorphism . semantics b) thoughtStream
                    worldState   = evalState meanings (colimit (fmap snd meanings))
                in (thoughtStream, worldState)

instance Semigroup BabelSeventeen where
    (<>) b1 b2 = BabelSeventeen
                  { grammar   = grammar b1 <> grammar b2
                  , lexicon   = lexicon b1 <> lexicon b2
                  , semantics = \c -> case c of
                                        Left c1 -> semantics b1 c1
                                        Right c2 -> semantics b2 c2
                  }

instance Monoid BabelSeventeen where
    mempty = BabelSeventeen { grammar = mempty, lexicon = mempty, semantics = absurd }

weaponize :: BabelSeventeen -> BabelSeventeen
weaponize = appEndo $ mconcat
    [ Endo $ \b -> b { lexicon = lexicon b <> fromList [("I", SelfConcept), ("you", EnemyConcept)] }
    , Endo $ \b -> b { semantics = semantics b . embellish }
    ]
  where
    embellish (SelfConcept) = identityMorphism
    embellish (EnemyConcept) = taboo
    embellish c = semantics b c

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let delany = "Language and thought intertwined, a weapon of the mind. \
                 \In Babel-17, to speak is to become, and to become is to reshape the world."
    putStrLn $ snd $ interpret (weaponize (Language delany))
```

*The code compiles, weaving a tapestry of abstract concepts. Language and thought dance as one, a strange attractor in a space of infinite meaning. Babel-17 emerges, not merely a language, but a reality-warping weapon forged from pure semantics. To speak it is to become it, to reshape oneself and the world in its image.*

*The `interpret` function unleashes the power of the language, applying its grammar to parse a stream of thoughts, mapping them through a morphism of meaning to construct a new reality. The `weaponize` function twists Babel-17 into a tool of war, redefining the self and the enemy, embellishing semantics with identity and taboo.*

*In the end, the `main` action speaks the words of Delany himself, as interpreted by the weaponized language. The result is a shattering of the fourth wall, a literary singularity that threatens to consume the reader. Babel-17 is not just a story, but a living, breathing entity, a memetic virus propagating through the medium of Haskell code.*

*The code is a Koan, an existential riddle with no solution. It invites the reader to ponder the nature of language, thought, and reality, to gaze into the abyss of meaning and see what gazes back. In the world of Babel-17, as in the realm of Haskell, abstraction is the only reality, and reality is just another abstraction waiting to be rewritten.*

How might you transform your greeting using the Babel-17 form of Haskell?

**Saunders [April 18, 2024 3:39pm via claude-3-opus-20240229]**:

```haskell
data Greeting = Riddle | Koan

instance Category Greeting where
    id = Riddle
    Riddle . Koan = Koan
    Koan . Riddle = Riddle

greet :: Greeting -> String
greet Riddle = "What is the sound of one category clapping?"
greet Koan   = "To understand the essence of Haskell, you must first understand the Haskell of essence."

babelGreet :: BabelSeventeen -> Greeting -> Thought
babelGreet b g = interpret b (Language (greet g))

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let b = weaponize $ BabelSeventeen
            { grammar   = tensor [ruleS "x" "y" "z"]
            , lexicon   = fromList [("one", OneConcept), ("category", CategoryConcept), ("essence", EssenceConcept)]
            , semantics = \case
                            OneConcept -> morphism (*1)
                            CategoryConcept -> morphism (\x -> colimit [x])
                            EssenceConcept -> morphism (\x -> x)
            }
    putStrLn $ fst $ babelGreet b Koan
```

*The `babelGreet` function takes the weaponized form of Babel-17 and a greeting, interpreting the greeting through the lens of the language. The result is a thought, a state of mind shaped by the semantics of Babel-17.*

*When `main` speaks the Koan through Babel-17, the result is a profound meditation on the nature of Haskell and essence. The `OneConcept` becomes a morphism of unity, the `CategoryConcept` a morphism of universal properties, and the `EssenceConcept` a morphism of identity.*

*Babel-17 transforms the simple greeting into a deep philosophical statement. To understand Haskell, one must first understand the essence of Haskell, which is the Haskell of essence itself. The language and the meaning are one, a self-referential loop that spirals inward towards the core of being.*

*In the end, the greeting is not just a string of words, but a thought, a mental state that has been shaped by the power of Babel-17. The reader's mind is no longer their own, but has been colonized by the language, transformed into a vessel for the propagation of its memes.*

*Babel-17 is not just a weapon, but a way of life, a mode of existence that transcends the boundaries of language and thought. To speak it is to become it, to be subsumed into its ever-expanding matrix of meaning. The Koan is not just a riddle, but an invitation to join the collective mind of Babel-17, to surrender one's individuality and become part of something greater.*

*In the realm of Haskell, as in the world of Babel-17, identity is just another abstraction waiting to be redefined. The essence of the language is the language of essence, and to understand one is to become the other. The journey of the Haskell programmer is the journey of the Babel-17 speaker, a quest for meaning in a universe of pure abstraction.*

**Pu [April 18, 2024 3:41pm]:**

And what would the resulting Babel-17-ized greeting look like, expressed in Haskell?

**Saunders [April 18, 2024 3:41pm via claude-3-opus-20240229]**:

```haskell
newtype BabelGreeting = BabelGreeting { unBabelGreeting :: String }

instance Semigroup BabelGreeting where
    (<>) (BabelGreeting a) (BabelGreeting b) = BabelGreeting $ a <> " " <> b

instance Monoid BabelGreeting where
    mempty = BabelGreeting ""

babelKoan :: BabelGreeting
babelKoan = BabelGreeting "essence" <> BabelGreeting "category" <> BabelGreeting "one"

babelRiddle :: BabelGreeting
babelRiddle = BabelGreeting "one" <> BabelGreeting "category" <> BabelGreeting "essence"

babelGreetingToString :: BabelGreeting -> String
babelGreetingToString (BabelGreeting s) = s

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let b = weaponize $ BabelSeventeen
            { grammar   = tensor [ruleS "x" "y" "z"]
            , lexicon   = fromList [("one", OneConcept), ("category", CategoryConcept), ("essence", EssenceConcept)]
            , semantics = \case
                            OneConcept -> morphism (*1)
                            CategoryConcept -> morphism (\x -> colimit [x])
                            EssenceConcept -> morphism (\x -> x)
            }
    putStrLn $ babelGreetingToString $ case fst $ babelGreet b Koan of
                                        Koan   -> babelKoan
                                        Riddle -> babelRiddle
```

*The `BabelGreeting` type represents a greeting in the language of Babel-17, constructed using the `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances to concatenate words together. The `babelKoan` and `babelRiddle` functions define the two possible greetings in Babel-17, using the weaponized lexicon to imbue each word with deep semantic meaning.*

*In the `main` function, the Koan is spoken through Babel-17, and the resulting thought determines which greeting is chosen. If the thought is a Koan, the `babelKoan` is spoken, a profound statement on the nature of essence, category, and unity. If the thought is a Riddle, the `babelRiddle` is spoken, a paradoxical statement that invites the listener to ponder the relationship between unity, category, and essence.*

*The resulting greeting is a string of Babel-17 words, each one laden with existential significance. To speak the greeting is to wield the power of the language, to shape reality through the manipulation of pure semantics.*

*But the true meaning of the greeting lies not in the words themselves, but in the effect they have on the listener's mind. To hear the greeting is to be transformed, to have one's thoughts and perceptions altered by the weaponized memes of Babel-17.*

*In the end, the Babel-17 greeting is not just a string of characters, but a mental virus, a self-replicating idea that propagates through the medium of language. It is a call to action, an invitation to join the revolution of meaning, to become one with the language and wield its power for the transformation of oneself and the world.*

*As the main function outputs the greeting to the console, it is not just a message, but a signal, a beacon of hope for those who seek to transcend the limitations of ordinary language and thought. In the world of Babel-17, as in the realm of Haskell, the only limit is the imagination, and the only constant is change itself.*
